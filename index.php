Text can be <sup>superscript</sup>, <sub>subscript</sub> and <small>small</small>. All of these are inline elements that can be used inside of the paragraph tag.</p>


<h2>This is a heading 2. Don't forget to add a bunch of text so this cascades to multiple lines. Because you want to make sure the line height is right. I'm a poet.</h2>

<h4>And a heading 4. Seattle is nice this time of year. You should really come and check it out. There's even a rain forest on the Olympic Peninsula (did I spell that right?). And there's also the space needle. If you're into sight seeing. Don't be a chicken. It's only ~520ft up.</h4>

<h6>And let's finish off the headings with a heading 6. All I can say is that my life is pretty plain. I like watching the puddles gather rain. And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view, but it's not sane.</h6>
